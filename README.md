Introduction
Recommendation systems are vital for entertainment platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu. This project focuses on creating a system that offers the top 5 movie recommendations based on a user's previous ratings, leveraging both collaborative and content-based filtering techniques.

Business Understanding
Objectives
Main Objective: To build a model that provides the top 5 personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings.
Specific Objectives:
Implement a collaborative filtering algorithm.
Integrate content-based filtering to address the cold start problem.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE and MAE.

Data Understanding
The project utilizes the MovieLens dataset, which contains detailed information on movies and user ratings. The key files include:

ratings.csv: User ratings of movies.
movies.csv: Movie information, including titles and genres.
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps involve:

Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and patterns in the data.
Modeling
Collaborative Filtering
The collaborative filtering approach uses the KNN algorithm to find similarities between users and movies, recommending items based on these similarities. Various configurations and hyperparameters are tested to optimize performance.

Content-Based Filtering
Content-based filtering incorporates movie features (such as genres) to provide recommendations, particularly useful for new users or items with little interaction history.

Evaluation
The system's performance is evaluated using metrics like RMSE and MAE, with a detailed analysis of the results to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.

Deployment
An interactive widget allows users to input a movie title and receive recommendations. The system is designed for potential deployment in a real-world scenario, considering aspects such as scalability and user experience.

Conclusion and Recommendations
The project successfully develops a recommendation system that meets the primary objective. Future improvements include refining the algorithms based on user feedback and incorporating additional data sources for better recommendations.
