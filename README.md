BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING.

This project uses the MovieLens dataset, a popular dataset for recommendation systems, to analyze user ratings and preferences. However, the dataset faces challenges such as sparsity and cold start problems. To address this, collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques are proposed. The goal is to create a comprehensive recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions based on user ratings and preferences, with real-time feedback to continually improve the accuracy and relevance of recommendations. The success metric should be an accuracy score of at least 80%.

Objectives

Main Objective: To build a model that provides the top 5 personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings.

Specific Objectives:

- Implement a collaborative filtering algorithm.
 
- Integrate content-based filtering to address the cold start problem.

- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE and MAE.

DATA UNDERSTANDING.

The project utilizes the MovieLens dataset, which contains detailed information on movies and user ratings. The key files include:

- ratings.csv: User ratings of movies. It contains 100836 rows and 4 columns.

- movies.csv: Movie information, including titles and genres. It contains 9742 rows and 3 columns.
  
DATA PREPROCESSING.

Data preprocessing steps involve:

- Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.

- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and patterns in the data.
  
MODELLING.
  
1. Collaborative Filtering

The collaborative filtering approach uses the KNN algorithm to find similarities between users and movies, recommending items based on these similarities. Various configurations and hyperparameters are tested to optimize performance.

2. Content-Based Filtering
   
Content-based filtering incorporates movie features (such as genres) to provide recommendations, particularly useful for new users or items with little interaction history.

EVALUATION.

The system's performance is evaluated using metrics like RMSE and MAE, with a detailed analysis of the results to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.

DEPLOYMENT.

An interactive widget allows users to input a movie title and receive recommendations. The system is designed for potential deployment in a real-world scenario, considering aspects such as scalability and user experience.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS.

The project successfully develops a recommendation system that meets the primary objective. Future improvements include refining the algorithms based on user feedback and incorporating additional data sources for better recommendations.
